Use README.md to explain your project’s purpose, setup instructions, and how to run the code.

Notebooks vs. scripts: Use Jupyter for experimentation, then refactor the code into scripts/modules in src/.

Data: Never commit large or sensitive datasets to your repository. Use .gitignore to exclude them.

Version control: Commit often with meaningful messages.

Example of Jupyter notebook structure
# File: data_analysis.py

# 1. Import libraries
import os
import re
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from tqdm import tqdm
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import time
import matplotlib.sankey as san
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import plotly.express as px

# 2. Your functions and classes would go here

# 3. Main code logic
def main():
    # Your data analysis and visualization code
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

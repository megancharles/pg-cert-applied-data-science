Use README.md to explain your project’s purpose, setup instructions, and how to run the code.

Notebooks vs. scripts: Use Jupyter for experimentation, then refactor the code into scripts/modules in src/.

Data: Never commit large or sensitive datasets to your repository. Use .gitignore to exclude them.

Version control: Commit often with meaningful messages.
